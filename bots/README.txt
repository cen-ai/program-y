This folder contains a number of specific bots

Alice2 - Is the bot that was created to support AIML 2, and is an updated version of Alicebot which was the original
bot created for AIML 1. It has a comprehensive set of grammars but is very America in some of its responses. Also I
some of the more complex grammars either rely on none AIML 2.0 which are only implemented in the Pandora Bots. Still its
a good start for mosts people

CEN - This bot was forked from the program-y y-bot for the cen.ai project.

Rosie - A second bot created by the creators of AIML. Rosie has less grammars but is designed and documented to be
the foundation for AIML 2.0 bot development. Easier to work with than Alice2, but still has one or 2 tags which are not
AIML 2 compliant and only work with Pandora bots

Professor - A bot that is managed by user gimisa@yahoo.fr. He took a poorly defined and inaccurate version of WordNet
grammar called The Professor, make them entirely AIML 2.0 compliant and fixed a wide range of bugs, duplications and
other areas of inconsistency. A huge effort and a big shout out to him from the Program-Y Team who count him as one
of our own now

Y-Bot - This is my bot, being developed slowly with a complete set of grammar tests. Y-Bot is designed to both have a
good core knowledge for general discussions, a personality and also support a set of industry extensions such for use
iin Energy, Banking, and Telecoms
