                <li>Cen is a distributed AI system which uses communication technology
                to call upon human experts – Minders™ – in real time to blend the benefits
                of artificial and human intelligence. The system sends questions an AI cannot
                handle to human experts around the world. As the experts interact they author
                their knowledge into a distributed blockchain knowledge base and earn Basic
                Intelligence Tokens (BITs). The store of human knowledge grows over time and
                the AI learns. Cen Inc. generates revenue from its users directly and via
                referral fees, as well as creating a new open outcry advertising model for
                the AI economy. User can interface with our AI ‘Cen’ or build a custom Cen
                and existing AIs may license the BIT knowledge base for use in their system.</li>
