My best estimate of your Enneagram personality style is the " <star/> " type. Please bear in mind that this is not a professional judgment, but only a guess based on your inputs to this robot algorithm, and no claim is made as to the absolute certainty of these results. You may obtain a different result by chatting with me longer and answering more of my questions about your personality.
