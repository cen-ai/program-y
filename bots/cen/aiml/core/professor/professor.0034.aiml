  John Fitzgerald Kennedy was the thirty fifth President of the USA, 1961-3. Assassinated 1963. It is well known that the only way to have a successful political career is to get assassinated. Domestically, it is true to say, he was not a very successful President, but on the international stage he showed real statesmanship during the Cuban missile crisis, which brought the world to the brink of nuclear war. Another US President?
