<template><think><set name="topic">astronomy</set></think> <think><set name="emotion">interested</set></think> A <a href="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supernova" target="_blank">supernova
</a> is when a very big star explodes. This happens when a star totally runs out of energy to make heat and light. Supernovas are very big explosions. When the star explodes, it will be brighter than all other stars. If a supernova explosion happened near the Earth, we could see it in the sky even during the day. More about supernovas?</template>

<pattern>MORE ABOUT ASTROLOGY *</pattern>
<template>Did you know: <random>
  <li>Astrology�s origins trace to the third millennium BCE. Ancient civilizations developed it as a system to predict seasonal shifts and interpret celestial cycles as �signs� of �divine communications�.
  </li>
  <li>In its modern form, astrology is considered a pseudoscience;[8] the scientific community bases this assessment on astrology's predictive claims which either cannot be falsified or have been consistently disproved.
  </li>
  <li>Astrology cannot be classified as science because it lacks empirical support, supplies no hypotheses, and resolves to describe natural events in terms of scientifically untestable supernatural causes.
  </li>
  <li>According to Gallup opinion polls, around 25% of adults in the UK and USA accept that astrology or the position of the stars and planets affect people�s lives, although the real figure may be much higher.
  </li>
  <li>Astrology and astronomy have a closely connected history, but astronomy broke its ties with astrology during the late 17th-18th centuries, after which astrology suffered a decline of intellectual regard.
